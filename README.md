ET4394 - wireless IoT and Local Area Networks

Ideas:
- collect data for 1 in every 5 minutes (estimate amount of data)
- filter based on chipset
- plot chipset over time
- number of resends per chipset -> efficiency of chipset?

## TODO
### Terry 
- data collection script

### Bram
- extracting data -> filter based on chipset vs time
- configure pi to collect data
